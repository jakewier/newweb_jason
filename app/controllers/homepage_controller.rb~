    @paragraph = "1.	Mr Buffett captured and shared this image because the photo helps to spread awareness to the large issue of world hunger. Famine is something that we as Americans tend to overlook because we are used to living our lives with such an overabundance of food and resources. We do not stop to consider how blessed we are as often as we should. Famine is a huge problem in Uganda, as well as other countries all over the world. This photo is particularly hard to look at it because of the fact that it is such a young child that is clearly suffering from malnutrition and hunger."
    @paragraph2 = "2.	As an Aggie, this photo interests me because it forces me to face the issue of world hunger. The photo makes me sort of take a step back and think about how often I personally take things for granted. I have always grown up with the essentials such as food and shelter, and the idea of having to live without one or both of those things is both shocking and heart breaking to me, especially when you see it affecting children such as in this photo. Being a member of the Texas A&M baseball team, we go around to many Childrens Centers, hospitals, and other places in order to have fun with underprivileged children, and it is extremely sad to see that some of these children so close to home are also having to deal with similar problems to those displayed in this photo."
    @paragraph3 = "3.	The story depicted in this photo relates to youth development/community development in that this child, as well as the community that he lives in, clearly are having to deal with issues that have simply become a way of life to them. This is a child who has probably never experienced being “full” or “stuffed” after a large meal, and who really does not even know whenever his next meal will be. The community surrounding him has little to none to contribute to him, because they are all having to deal with the same issues themselves. This child has had to grow up and experience things that no child should have to go through. Can you imagine what it would be like to not ever really have a childhood at all?"
